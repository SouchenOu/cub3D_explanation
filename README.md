# cub3D_explination

This project‚Äôs objectives are similar to all this first year‚Äôs objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.

As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.

To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

Ray-Casting:
___________


I will explain here the formulas that I have used to implement the ray-casting. This raycast has been made in order to create a 3D game Cub3D. The project still in progress ‚öôÔ∏èüõ†.

Introduction:
---------------

I will explain what kind of calculation I will used to create, draw, and move around the walls.

Well let me firstly tell you what are the math concepts that I will used in the formulas. Right triangle trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA), and Vectors: Components(X , Y), Quantity (magnitude and direction).
