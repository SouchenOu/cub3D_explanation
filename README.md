Ray-Casting:
___________


I will explain here the formulas that I have used to implement the ray-casting. This raycast has been made in order to create a 3D game Cub3D. The project still in progress ⚙️🛠.

Note: Im NoT DoNe yEt 🧟‍♀️

Introduction:
---------------

I will explain what kind of calculation I will used to create, draw, and move around the walls.

Well let me firstly tell you what are the math concepts that I will used in the formulas. Right triangle trigonometry (SOHCAHTOA), and Vectors: Components(X , Y), Quantity (magnitude and direction).
